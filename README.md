Developer Tools project
==============

Experimental project to build small tools useful for developers

The "nice-to-fix" list:
* Being able to group templates per content type in the "Templates"-tool
* Move existing event gadget into this tool or create a new tool to troubleshoot events
* Revert to Default and Content Type Analyzer should be merged in some way, seems weird with 2 tools.
